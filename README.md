##### 1. Specify a Causal Model.

- What is the effect of different types of treatments on the three-year survival among patients with glottic cancer?

##### 2. Translate your question into a formal target causal parameter, defined using counter-factuals.

The counterfactuals of interest are ($Y^{a}$:a∈={0,1}). Here, Y1
 is the counterfactual exam score if, possibly contrary to fact, a student ate dark chocolate and Y0
 is the counterfactual exam score if, possibly contrary to fact, a student did not eat dark chocolate.

##### 3. Specify your observed data and its link to the causal model.



##### 4. Identify.



##### 5. Commit to a Statistical Model and Estimand (target parameter of the observed datadistribution).
